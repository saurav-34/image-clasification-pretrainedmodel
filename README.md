 # Transformer Model

This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer model from the research paper *Attention Is All You Need* by Vaswani et al. The model is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, primarily in natural language processing (NLP).

## Features
- Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism
- Positional Encoding for sequence order handling
- Encoder-Decoder architecture for efficient translation tasks
- Layer Normalization and Dropout for stable training
- Adam Optimizer with Learning Rate Scheduling

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Transformer
Run the following command to train the model:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.0002
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the model on a test set:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoint.pth --dataset test_data.txt
```

### Fine-Tuning on a Custom Dataset
Modify `train.py` and specify the dataset path:
```bash
python train.py --data_path custom_dataset.txt
```

## Future Work
- Implement Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification
- Experiment with sparse attention for efficiency
- Extend to multimodal tasks (text + images)
